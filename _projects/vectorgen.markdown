This project was part of my Web Interactivity and Engagement course in my graduate program at the University of Florida. For our final project, I worked on a team of three that was supposed to create a custom WordPress site for our client, VectorGen. Our site was required to have a home page, about page, contact page, blog page, 404 page, and any other pages requested by the client. Additionally, we were supposed to use a minimum of 3 widgets and 3 plugins.
