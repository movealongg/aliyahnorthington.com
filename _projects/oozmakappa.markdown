This project was part of my Advanced Web Topics 1 course in my graduate program at the University of Florida. For this project, we were supposed to create a fully functional, animal themed (fictional or non fictional) website that demonstrated the use of responsive design and CSS animation. For my theme, I chose to do Oozma Kappa, the fictional fraternity from Pixar’s Monsters University.
