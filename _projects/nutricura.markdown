This project was part of my Capstone course in my graduate program at the University of Florida. The goal of our Capstone course was to combine all of the skills that we learned in our master’s program into one semester-long project. I worked on a team of five for the duration of my Capstone. The project included a situation analysis, logo design proposal and brand manifesto, creative brief/branding guide, website wireframes and mockups, campaign strategy and design pieces, usability testing, a fully functional e-commerce website, and a final campaign document.

The website itself was hosted on a teammate’s domain because they have a Divi subscription. Screenshots of the website can be seen in the campaign document starting on page 81. The campaign document is linked below in my Creative Cloud due to its large file size.
