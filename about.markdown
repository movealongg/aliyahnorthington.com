I’m a web designer living in Madison, Alabama. I recently graduated from the University of Florida with a Master of Arts in Mass Communication with a specialization in Web Design (it’s a handful, I know).

When I was growing up, I always heard that if you choose a job you love, you will never have to work a day in your life. For the longest time, I had no idea what I wanted to be when I grew up.  It wasn’t until my first web design course that I suddenly knew exactly what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.

For nearly every assignment in my web design class, I found myself completely immersed in the projects. Hours would pass by and I wouldn’t even notice because I loved it so much! That one course changed the course of my life and led me to pursue a graduate degree in web design, and ultimately a career.

When I’m not chasing my dreams, you can find me keeping up with my Goodreads reading challenge, catching up on my many tv shows, attempting hand lettering as a hobby, or lounging with my boyfriend Jesse and our doggo Yoshi.
